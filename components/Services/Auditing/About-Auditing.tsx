            Auditing is a structured, independent, and evidence-based
            examination of an organizationâ€™s records, operations, systems, and
            processes. It plays a critical role in evaluating financial integrity,
            regulatory compliance, operational effectiveness, and governance standards.
            Audits provide the transparency required to build trust with stakeholders while enabling
            organizations to uncover inefficiencies, mitigate risks, and implement best practices.
