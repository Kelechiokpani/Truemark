            Outsourcing is the strategic practice of engaging external
            service providers to manage specific business operations,
            processes, or functions. This approach enables organizations to
            concentrate on their core competencies, reduce internal workload,
            control costs, and gain access to
            industry-leading expertise and technology without having
            to manage those functions in-house
          </p>
